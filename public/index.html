      <h1>Speak with a swimbot today!</h1>
      <p>Here you can have a conversation with a swimbot.
        Ask them whatever you'd like and follow up on your questions. They have some memory, so they will be able to
      keep track of the conversation (up to a certain extent!). Also, be sure to wait a few seconds after clicking submit.
    Swimbots need a bit of time to think! <br><br>
  Be creative. For example, you can ask questions as if you are a swimbot interacting with them as well. Try to build a friendship.
See what secrets or special places they will show or tell you about. Can you make a new friend?</p>
